  🤖 AI Verdict: LOW RISK
  The changelog for upgrading `pyproj` from `3.7.1` to `3.7.2` includes several updates and improvements, 
but no breaking changes or significant alterations that would affect the stability of a production 
codebase. The primary changes involve dependency bumps, documentation updates, and maintenance tasks. 
Here's a detailed breakdown of the risks associated with each change:

  Reasoning: The changelog does not include any changes to public APIs, function signatures, or default 
values that could introduce breaking changes. The only notable changes are dependency bumps and 
documentation updates, which are generally low-risk unless they affect compatibility with other 
dependencies in the project. Additionally, there is a change to the minimum PROJ version requirement, but 
this is specified as 9.4, which should be compatible with existing setups if the current PROJ version 
meets or exceeds this requirement.
